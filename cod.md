##### Code of Conduct

We want all attendees to have an enjoyable experience at ResCompLeedsCon. All attendees - delegates, speakers, volunteers, organisers - are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. If necessary organisers will act to enforce it.

##### The short version

If you have a question about the code of conduct or wish to report misconduct, please email [rescomp@leeds.ac.uk​](rescomp@leeds.ac.uk​).

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.

The Research Computing Leeds Conference Organising committee is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference for everyone, regardless of sex, age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and parenthood, race, religion or belief (or lack thereof), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, technical choices, experience level or any other dimension of diversity. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly conference for all.
