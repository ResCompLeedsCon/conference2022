  bio: >
    
    David's research is on artificial intelligence and particularly in 
    computer vision. He pioneered the use of three-dimensional geometric 
    models for tracking deformable structures in natural scenes and 
    contributed to establishing statistical approaches to learning of
    shape and motion as one of the pre-eminent paradigms in the
    field. He has been Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research and Innovation 
    at the University of Leeds, visiting professor at the MIT Media Lab, 
    chair of the EPSRC ICT Strategic Advisory Team, and chair of the 
    Academic Advisory Group of the Worldwide Universities Network. 
    He is a Fellow of the European Association for Artificial 
    Intelligence (EurAI), a Distinguished Fellow of the British 
    Machine Vision Association, and a Fellow of the International 
    Association for Pattern Recognition. He is Director of the 
    UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence 
    for Medical Diagnosis and Care at the University of Leeds.

    My research interests are related to three domains: 
    linguistics (primarily computational linguistics and corpus linguistics),
    cognitive science and communication studies.
    Probably the most interesting bit in my recent research 
    is digital curation of representative corpora automatically 
    collected from the Web, i.e., their annotation in terms of
    genres, domains or morphosyntactic categories. The current set of 
    resources includes very large corpora for Arabic, Chinese, 
    English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian 
    and Spanish.

    I am a computational cancer biologist interested in the use of
    high-throughput sequencing to characterise brain tumour genomes 
    and transcriptomes, and the integrated analysis of datasets to 
    further understand the development and progression of brain cancer. 
    My research focuses on inspecting genomic and transcriptomic 
    heterogeneity present within brain tumours and across stages of
    brain cancer development and progression.
    I believe that the most biologically and clinically relevant 
    inferences come from continual iteration of computational and 
    wet-lab approaches, and this is the remit within my group. 
    I am interested in investigating intratumour heterogeneity 
    in glioblastoma (GBM); specifically, I wish to test whether 
    treatment-resistant subclones emerge in recurrent tumours, and 
    characterise them in clinically relevant ways in multiple patients. 
    I am a trained computational biologist with expertise in 
    next-generation sequencing data analysis.

    Currently, as a third-year PhD in the University of Leeds,  
    I have been looking into applying Bayesian modelling to enhance 
    medical imaging by combining various sources such as PET and MRI.

    I am a final year PhD student in the Computational Chemistry, Biomaterials and Interfaces Modelling group within the School of Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Leeds. I am interested in using quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulation to study the conformational energetics, structural chemistry and physico-chemical interactions that drive virulence, pathogenicity and chronicity within mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in the lungs of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. During my PhD research I have used simulation to elucidate the key geometrical principles behind cation-induced biofilm matrix stabilisation, in addition to elucidating the molecular functionality and site-directed interactions that permit the motions of cell-to-cell signals through the biofilm matrix. More recently, I have been using simulation to predict the effects that novel therapeutics have on biofilm matrix morphology.
