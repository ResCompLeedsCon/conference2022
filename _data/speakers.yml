    "
    David's research is on artificial intelligence and particularly in 
    computer vision. He pioneered the use of three-dimensional geometric 
    models for tracking deformable structures in natural scenes and 
    contributed to establishing statistical approaches to learning of
    shape and motion as one of the pre-eminent paradigms in the
    field. He has been Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research and Innovation 
    at the University of Leeds, visiting professor at the MIT Media Lab, 
    chair of the EPSRC ICT Strategic Advisory Team, and chair of the 
    Academic Advisory Group of the Worldwide Universities Network. 
    He is a Fellow of the European Association for Artificial 
    Intelligence (EurAI), a Distinguished Fellow of the British 
    Machine Vision Association, and a Fellow of the International 
    Association for Pattern Recognition. He is Director of the 
    UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence 
    for Medical Diagnosis and Care at the University of Leeds.

    "
    My research interests are related to three domains: 
    linguistics (primarily computational linguistics and corpus linguistics),
    cognitive science and communication studies.
    Probably the most interesting bit in my recent research 
    is digital curation of representative corpora automatically 
    collected from the Web, i.e., their annotation in terms of
    genres, domains or morphosyntactic categories. The current set of 
    resources includes very large corpora for Arabic, Chinese, 
    English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian 
    and Spanish.
