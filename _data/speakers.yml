    David's research is on artificial intelligence and particularly in 
    computer vision. He pioneered the use of three-dimensional geometric 
    models for tracking deformable structures in natural scenes and 
    contributed to establishing statistical approaches to learning of
    shape and motion as one of the pre-eminent paradigms in the
    field. He has been Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research and Innovation 
    at the University of Leeds, visiting professor at the MIT Media Lab, 
    chair of the EPSRC ICT Strategic Advisory Team, and chair of the 
    Academic Advisory Group of the Worldwide Universities Network.

    My research interests are related to three domains: 
    linguistics (primarily computational linguistics and corpus linguistics),
    cognitive science and communication studies.
    Probably the most interesting bit in my recent research 
    is digital curation of representative corpora automatically 
    collected from the Web, i.e., their annotation in terms of
    genres, domains or morphosyntactic categories. The current set of 
    resources includes very large corpora for Arabic, Chinese, 
    English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian 
    and Spanish.

    I am a computational cancer biologist interested in the use of
    high-throughput sequencing to characterise brain tumour genomes 
    and transcriptomes, and the integrated analysis of datasets to 
    further understand the development and progression of brain cancer. 
    My research focuses on inspecting genomic and transcriptomic 
    heterogeneity present within brain tumours and across stages of
    brain cancer development and progression.
    I believe that the most biologically and clinically relevant 
    inferences come from continual iteration of computational and 
    wet-lab approaches, and this is the remit within my group. 
    I am interested in investigating intratumour heterogeneity 
    in glioblastoma (GBM); specifically, I wish to test whether 
    treatment-resistant subclones emerge in recurrent tumours, and 
    characterise them in clinically relevant ways in multiple patients. 
    I am a trained computational biologist with expertise in 
    next-generation sequencing data analysis.

During my PhD research I have used simulation to elucidate the key geometrical principles behind cation-induced biofilm matrix stabilisation, in addition to elucidating the molecular functionality and site-directed interactions that permit the motions of cell-to-cell signals through the biofilm matrix. More recently, I have been using simulation to predict the effects that novel therapeutics have on biofilm matrix morphology.

In the meantime, he likes to independently research ways to reduce the cost of operating applications using Cloud Services and reduce the amount of data needed for those applications to function. This way he aims at making software development more affordable to everyone, from hobbyists and start-ups to large companies and organizations.

    Hello! I'm Indumini! Having spent two decades in the UAE and Sri Lanka, and after experiencing first-hand the positive impact that technological development can have on a country, I began to slowly develop a budding fascination with tech. Later, with the realisation that my curiosity and wanderlust could no longer be kept bounded, I decided in 2018 to set sail for the UK in search of better prospects. By the summer of 2021, I successfully graduated from the University of Leeds with a bachelor’s in Electronics and Computer Engineering. Having had my interest piqued by a glimpse of the value and variety of data science applications discovered through my final year project research, and seeing that my wish to work for a meaningful cause can be fulfilled by joining LIDA, I decided to apply for their internship programme. At the moment, I am thoroughly enjoying the programme, the proof being my excitement at the chance to meet all of you, learn about other amazing works and discuss a project that I am currently involved in (and quite passionate about) through the Research Computing Leeds Conference! When I am not reading about machine learning algorithms or sharing my data science encounters with others however, you can often find me spending my downtime listening to music and journaling away in a corner. :)

    I am part of a team working on a multidisciplinary project between the Business School and the School of Design that focuses on finding optimisation models for sustainable fashion, which works on different solutions to reduce the amount of waste generated during the cutting stage of fabric, additionally, we are working on the post-consumer textile waste problem and upcycling.

    The fashion industry impact on the environment is a significant global problem. One avenue for reducing the industry’s global impact is by reducing the amount of waste generated in the cutting stage of fabric. This research aims to transform the “design” and “make” processes from linear to circular and allow designers to have aesthetic control when designing a zero-waste or a minimal waste design. By developing an optimisation algorithm that aims to minimise the waste generated from the cutting stage of the fabric where irregular shapes need to be cut from a fabric roll, also known as the “Two Dimensional Irregular Strip Packing Problem”. Through a collaboration with a designer, we aim at integrating the designer’s design making process with the algorithm design to inspire the designer to make adjustments to the initial design through an iterative process until a satisfactory marker with minimal to zero waste is achieved.

  name: "David"
  surname: "Head"
  title: "Lecturer"
  company: School of Computing
  bio: >
    David has a long/old research career in using simplified models to probe complex systems, where the very process of deciding what simplifications can and cannot be made adds to the insight and understanding of the problem, whilst also reducing cluster load and generally being a good cluster citizen. Current areas of interest include fibre networks and multi-component modelling of bacterial colonies - for the latter, the greatest challenge often lies in convincing an application domain unused to modelling that the results of your simplified model still tell you something about the real world.

  name: Marlène 
  surname: Mengoni
  title: Associate Professor
  company: School of Mechanical Engineering
  bio: >
    Marlène Mengoni is an associate professor in computational medical engineering, researching how we can identify patient-specific sources of variation in musculoskeletal biomechanics and how this affects the performance of interventions and repairs. She has been an adopter of open-science since her PG studies and is an advocate of open-data and its relation to better research culture.

  name: Sarah 
  surname: Harris
  title: "Associate Professor"
  company: School of Physics and Astronomy
  bio: >
    Sarah Anne Harris (SAH) is a Principal Investigator in the School of Physics and Astronomy and the Astbury Centre for Structural and Molecular Biology at the University of Leeds. Her research aims to understand the mechanism underlying biological processes such as molecular recognition, DNA packing and the operation of molecular motors. She uses simulations of biomolecules on the both the atomistic and mesoscales, and is part of core team developing the Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) software for mesoscale simulation at Leeds. She has a strong interest in High Performance Computing (HPC), and promotes its use in the biosciences through the Computational Collaborative Project for Biomolecular Simulation (CCPBioSim).

  name: John 
  surname: Hodrien
  title: Research Software Engineer
  company: Research Computing
  bio: >
    John is a Research Software Engineer working within the Research IT team at the University of Leeds. Starting life as a Computer Scientist at Leeds; he taught parallel programming (C/C++; MPI/pthreads); before becoming a researcher within the Visualisation and Virtual Reality research group; all within the School of Computing. In these research roles; he has developed systems for working with pathology data with high resolution display clusters; and worked on a number of research projects on e-Science/Grid Computing. More recent work within IT involved providing and supporting a range of predominantly Linux solutions to research and teaching within Engineering; and more recently John has been a leader of this provision for the whole University.

    John has worked with a number of languages such as C/C++; Java; and Fortran; along with associated toolchains like Git; and has a soft spot for configuration management tools like Puppet; which has been used to provide standard configuration and deployment of systems and solutions at Leeds.
