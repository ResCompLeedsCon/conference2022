    David's research is on artificial intelligence and particularly in 
    computer vision. He pioneered the use of three-dimensional geometric 
    models for tracking deformable structures in natural scenes and 
    contributed to establishing statistical approaches to learning of
    shape and motion as one of the pre-eminent paradigms in the
    field. He has been Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research and Innovation 
    at the University of Leeds, visiting professor at the MIT Media Lab, 
    chair of the EPSRC ICT Strategic Advisory Team, and chair of the 
    Academic Advisory Group of the Worldwide Universities Network.

    My research interests are related to three domains: 
    linguistics (primarily computational linguistics and corpus linguistics),
    cognitive science and communication studies.
    Probably the most interesting bit in my recent research 
    is digital curation of representative corpora automatically 
    collected from the Web, i.e., their annotation in terms of
    genres, domains or morphosyntactic categories. The current set of 
    resources includes very large corpora for Arabic, Chinese, 
    English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian 
    and Spanish.

    I am a computational cancer biologist interested in the use of
    high-throughput sequencing to characterise brain tumour genomes 
    and transcriptomes, and the integrated analysis of datasets to 
    further understand the development and progression of brain cancer. 
    My research focuses on inspecting genomic and transcriptomic 
    heterogeneity present within brain tumours and across stages of
    brain cancer development and progression.
    I believe that the most biologically and clinically relevant 
    inferences come from continual iteration of computational and 
    wet-lab approaches, and this is the remit within my group. 
    I am interested in investigating intratumour heterogeneity 
    in glioblastoma (GBM); specifically, I wish to test whether 
    treatment-resistant subclones emerge in recurrent tumours, and 
    characterise them in clinically relevant ways in multiple patients. 
    I am a trained computational biologist with expertise in 
    next-generation sequencing data analysis.

I am interested in using quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulation to study the conformational energetics, structural chemistry and physico-chemical interactions that drive virulence, pathogenicity and chronicity within mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in the lungs of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. During my PhD research I have used simulation to elucidate the key geometrical principles behind cation-induced biofilm matrix stabilisation, in addition to elucidating the molecular functionality and site-directed interactions that permit the motions of cell-to-cell signals through the biofilm matrix. More recently, I have been using simulation to predict the effects that novel therapeutics have on biofilm matrix morphology.

  bio: >
    Alistair has moved from physics training, through commercial R&D on display technology and a PhD in human visual studies, to developing and supporting advanced optical microscopy technologies for nanoscale biological experiments. He is now moving into developing new analytical methods of the point cloud data generated in single-molecule localisation microscopy, to allow it to fulfil its potential for new discoveries and diagnostic methods in cell biology and medicine.

  bio: >
    I am an Associate Professor in Solid Earth Geophysics in the School of Earth and Environment. I mainly use first-principles calculations to predict the properties of minerals at the extreme conditions of the lower mantle, such as equation of state, elastic constants, thermal conductivity and phase transitions. To study larger numbers of atoms I also perform atomic scale simulations using pair potentials and am currently trying to develop machine learning potentials.

  bio: >
    Chris Rushton is a post-doctoral research fellow in the Institute for Transport Studies.  Chris' areas of research include air pollution and its links to transport, and the effectiveness of clean air zone policy.  Prior to working at ITS, Chris was a senior technologist at Connected Places Catapult where he developed and delivered projects related to the development of commercial solutions to air quality problems in the UK, EU and farther afield.  Chris is interested in creating research and tools to help air pollution legislators and policy makers develop interventions that deliver cleaner air for the tax payer in a fair and cost-effective manner.  Chris is just beginning his journey into new technology based research methods and is here both to inform people of the work being done in his field and also to learn how to improve his work from more experienced practitioners.
