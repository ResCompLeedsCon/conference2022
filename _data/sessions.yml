  title: "Curing Brain Cancer - with a Computer"
  description: >
    Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly form of adult brain 
    cancer. GBM cancer cells are messed up! They have been molecularly 
    rewired in ways that mean they grow when they shouldn't, reshape the 
    tissue surrounding them and are currently incurable. We use large 
    scale molecular profiling to try and understand this rewiring and 
    how we can counteract it. This means we create vast amounts of data 
    from noisy samples across many different molecular levels at differing 
    resolutions (from single cell to whole tissue). We believe these data 
    hold the information we need to cure brain cancer but we to get at 
    it we have to first have to code the heck out of it!

  title: "Using HPC to predict the spread of COVID19 misinformation"
  description: >
    I will present our project aimed to improve understanding of 
    COVID-19 misinformation chains in social media using AI tracing 
    tools.  We used our HPC cluster (1) to collect a corpus of about 
    2 million COVID-related messages and corresponding user profiles 
    from Facebook, Telegram and Twitter and (2) to develop AI classifiers 
    to make predictions about the properties of the messages and the
    profiles using Deep Learning frameworks. Our main hypothesis is 
    that the socio-demographic profile of the audience is an important 
    indicator for the likelihood of falling prey to misinformation, as 
    different readers differ in how much they might be willing to share 
    misinformation of different kinds.  We indeed found a strong positive 
    association of the likelihood of sharing COVID-19 misinformation with
    readers age and their right-wing political orientation. 
    Another association we observed concerns different preferences 
    for sharing misinformation genres, in particular, academic writing 
    vs personal stories.

  title: "CryoEM pipelines or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Use all the Cores"
  description: >
    
    As Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has been transformed over the 
    last decade we face new bottlenecks in the filed. one of them been 
    real time processing of the data. New software and scripts enable us 
    to use more processing power of both CPUs and GPUs in order to deal 
    with this bottleneck.

# panel sessions

  title: "Discussion Panel: Open Research"
  description: |
    
    Computational methods have a part to play in helping to enable or even ensure that research is open – reproducibility. At the very minimum code and any other “processing” of data or information are an important research output especially alongside the raw and processed or generated data and perhaps even as a first class research output in their own right. The big advantage of computational or code based processing is that it is possible to rerun the analyses and verify the results. This is much more problematic with GUI based tools which rarely record the processing journey.
    Could you reproduce your own research let alone that of another researcher?
    How does this apply in the different research disciplines?

  title: "Discussion Panel: Sustainability and research computing"
  description: |
    
    Computational communities are becoming increasingly aware of the energy cost associated with high performance computing, and the associated environmental footprint. In this panel we will discuss how to ensure that our computational research is performed responsibly. We will consider factors such as:

    1.  Making supercomputing “green”
    2.  Optimising code efficiency to minimise energy consumption
    3.  Simplifying our scientific questions to make our calculations less costly

  title: A modular, open-source pipeline for grading of Follicular Lymphoma with rapid transfer to other tasks
  description: >
    Cytological grading of Follicular Lymphoma (FL) involves identification and quantification of cancerous cells within lymph nodes. When conducted manually, it is only feasible for clinicians to sample ten sites from hundreds available. The process therefore suffers high sampling error and high inter-observer variability. Given these limitations, the utility of clinical cytological grading has been low.

    Advances in image-based deep learning have led to creation of models with expert-like performance in cancer classification. We report the development of a deep learning pipeline for automated grading of entire tissue samples, containing millions of cells. The methods are robust to technical variability, such as differences in staining; can be executed on consumer-level computing resources and can be adapted to other disease cases within a working week.

    Using the novel pipeline, we have conducted cell-level analysis of one of the largest FL image sets in the World. This has uncovered relationships between cytological grade and patient outcome. Through continued refinement, we aim to set the gold standard for cytological grading of large images, with clinical application.

  title: "Faster estimation of choice models using HPC"
  description: >
    The main goals of choice models are typically to predict a set of
    outcomes given a discrete set of choice alternatives and to 
    forecast choices given a change in choice context. Many 
    different economic and psychological concepts can be 
    incorporated within a choice model, leading to frequent
    implementation of very complex models.
    Additionally, recent technological advances have led to the 
    availability of a wider range of data for behavioural
    modelling. In particular, physiological data (eye-tracking, EEG, etc)
    and large-scale revealed preference data (e.g. travel card or 
    supermarket clubcard data) have meant that we have have more 
    complex and larger choice datasets.
    The combination of complex models for complex datasets requires 
    significant computational power, far beyond what can be computed
    in a reasonable time for standard desktops, 
    which may take weeks or months to compute estimates for the 
    model parameters that best explain the full set of choice observations.
    In this presentation, we demonstrate examples of how the Apollo 
    package in R allows us to run models on multiple cores, which can 
    be estimated at least 20 times faster with the Leeds HPC.
