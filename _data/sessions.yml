  description: "Part 1: Economic, societal and environmental impact, or the ‘non-academic’ impact of research, is becoming an increasingly important part of the research ecosystem. It is standard practice for researchers to be asked by funders to describe the benefits of their research and how they might enable that benefit to be achieved. This session offers a high-level step-by-step guide on how to incorporate impact into your research planning.<br /><br />
  
  Part 2: Sharing your research with the media is a great way to broaden its reach and raise your profile as a researcher, but what makes one story front-page material while others never get picked up to begin with? This session offers practical tips and techniques for communicating your research to the media and wider public – from crafting your story to taking advantage of the modern media landscape to maximise the chances of your story getting picked up."

  title: "Tidy data and introduction to OpenRefine"
  description: "This is a 'Bring your own device' session. Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too!<br /><br /> 

  Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research workflow. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent. OpenRefine is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these edits by hand."
