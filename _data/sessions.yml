  title: "Using HPC to predict the spread of COVID19 misinformation"
  description: >
    "I will present our project aimed to improve understanding of 
    COVID-19 misinformation chains in social media using AI tracing 
    tools.  We used our HPC cluster (1) to collect a corpus of about 
    2 million COVID-related messages and corresponding user profiles 
    from Facebook, Telegram and Twitter and (2) to develop AI classifiers 
    to make predictions about the properties of the messages and the
    profiles using Deep Learning frameworks. Our main hypothesis is 
    that the socio-demographic profile of the audience is an important 
    indicator for the likelihood of falling prey to misinformation, as 
    different readers differ in how much they might be willing to share 
    misinformation of different kinds.  We indeed found a strong positive 
    association of the likelihood of sharing COVID-19 misinformation with
    readers age and their right-wing political orientation. 
    Another association we observed concerns different preferences 
    for sharing misinformation genres, in particular, academic writing 
    vs personal stories."
