We’ve been busy getting things ready! Applications to attend ResBaz Auckland 2019 are now open until Friday 31st May.

The event is free (just bring your enthusiasm and willingness to participate) but since space is limited your responses will help us ensure we select a cross-section of researchers to provide a diverse and successful event. It is expected that attendees will be present for the full three days, 10-12 July, to gain the maximum possible benefit (and FUN) from the bazaar.

Places are limited and demand is high so please take some time to register your interest and consider your responses in the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciGV3lkelvW95Kyzh712VwPV_y7-oIIHKa9Q4YoM4_hgotpQ/viewform).

Registration does not guarantee a place at ResBaz Auckland 2019 - we will contact you to let you know if your application is successful. 

Please check the website or follow [@eResearchUoA](https://twitter.com/eresearchuoa) for programme updates, and email [researchdata@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:researchdata@auckland.ac.nz) if you have any questions.
